# SkyGAN

This repo provides base code for anyone looking to create GAN generated 2D density fields in place of 2LPT or GADGET-II/GADGET-III simulations of the universe. 

This version provides the bare minimum functionality required to do this with a conditional generative advisarial network. I will upload my more advanced version at a later date with more functionality and conditionalisation methods as well as a non-conditional GAN version.
