# SkyGAN

This repo provides base code for anyone looking to create GAN generated 2D density fields in place of 2LPT or GADGET-II/GADGET-III simulations of the universe. 

This version provides the bare minimum functionality required to do this with a conditional generative advisarial network. I will upload my more advanced version at a later date with more functionality and conditionalisation methods as well as a non-conditional GAN version.

Please reference the code if used in future work. Feel free to email me for more deatils, I have done many months worth of research in this areas and can help with any inquiries or if you're stuck. 

I have more advanced GAN montering functions on the way including live summary statitics of the GAN generated densityy fields as well as WGANs to the same effect.
